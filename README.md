*SmartStock - Learn the stock market without risking real money*

Manual:- 
SmartStock is a Stock Simulator for raising awareness about Stock Market Investments and its potential. It is a Next.js Project by Satyam Raj, written with Typescript and uses App Directory. The App features Dashboard to check your stock prices, including checking what is the best and worst doing stocks, including create graphs and all. It then features a Market Page with buying and selling APIs to buy and sell stocks. A watchlist to keep an eye on the best doing and upcoming stock news. Portfolio which shows you different graphs and all with recharts and custom tailwind to make it fun. A transaction history page which shows the past transactions. All within a Robust Next-auth implementation. 
There is also an admin section which gives you insights about other users and their data. They can also buy or sell stocks, but Admins also have the power to delete existing stocks or create newer stocks. They can also manipulate the stock market, and hike up or bear down the prices of the stocks. 
I am using a PostgreSQL database along with Prisma for easy integration and my DX. I am also using ShadCN UI for UI and easy development. BcryptJs to encrypt passwords from the users. Tanstack Table for creating better tables with Sorting, Pagination, Views, Search and much more. Recharts for charts implementation. Resend to send emails to users who want email-validation, and password recovery and all. Zod for typesafety and much more to be implementated soon.
